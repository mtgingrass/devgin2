<h2>Pack your Gear</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ep4uez">ScanSmart Laptop Backpack</a> is one of my most viewed YouTube videos. I have owned two of these now. My <a href="https://youtu.be/VTTnRMyFkB8">YouTube</a> video of the review was such a big hit; I decided to write a blog about it.</p>
<p>I want to share a few comments I've received from the video reviews. The feedback from others might motivate you to give the video a quick watch. It's a six-minute <a href="https://youtu.be/VTTnRMyFkB8">video</a>.</p>

Probably the best review of a backpack I’ve ever seen.

<p>It feels great to get comments on videos. When I first posted the video, I had no idea it would be such a big hit. So here is another comment from solidsnake58.</p>

Great review! You’ve done a man’s job, sir. Just what I needed to see.

<p>The comments are great, but please, check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/VTTnRMyFkB8">video.</a> for an in-depth review. Nothing beats having me unpack a completely stuffed laptop backpack packed with multiple laptops and a bunch of gear.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ep4uez">Swissgear 1900 ScanSmart™ Laptop Backpack</a> is built tough and is equipped with an extra-large main compartment. The zippers are rugged and oversized, which makes them simple to use with gloves on. In addition, it features some adjustable side compression straps, a padded back panel with plenty of ventilation.</p>
<p>You will see the backpack in the below image, heavily loaded with probably 50+ pounds of gear.</p>

<h2>Is the ScanSmart Backpack Worth it?</h2>
<p>The ScanSmart lay-flat technology allows for laptop-in-case TSA scanning for most portable computers. I have never used this feature, but it’s there.</p>

<p>I purposely bought this <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ep4uez">Swiss Gear</a>Backpack to hold two laptops simultaneously, and I am very impressed. There have been times I held three laptops in this bad boy! Don't ask!</p>
<p>The backpack is made out of a combination of fabric and polyester, and it holds up great! In addition, it has enough cushion that I feel safe setting it on the floor without much impact on my gear.</p>

<h2>Video Review of ScanSmart Backpack</h2>
<p>I posted this video a few years ago. So many people commented and said there were going to buy this <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ep4uez">bag</a> since then. I am not affiliated in any way with this product directly. The images don't do this backpack justice. You should watch the video if you made it this far.</p>

<p>The ScanSmart 1900 laptop backpack also has two water bottle pockets which I use constantly. I use one pocket for a water bottle and the other for my tripod (it has a strap to hold it down pretty well).</p>
<p>It has an easy access laptop compartment (side entry) but to be honest; both laptop entrances are easy to access, in my opinion.</p>
