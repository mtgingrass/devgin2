## Pack your Gear

The [ScanSmart Laptop Backpack](https://amzn.to/2Ep4uez) is one of my most viewed YouTube videos. I have owned two of these now. My [YouTube](https://youtu.be/VTTnRMyFkB8) video of the review was such a big hit, I decided to write a blog about it. 

Before I dive into the details, I want to share a few comments I've received over the years. The comments might motivate you to give the video a quick watch. It's a six-minute video.

It feels great to get comments on your videos. When I first posted this, I had no idea it would be such a big hit. Here is another comment from solidsnake58.

Great review!  You've done a man's job, sir.  Just what I needed to see.

The comments are great, but please, check out the [video.](https://youtu.be/VTTnRMyFkB8) for an in-depth review. Nothing beats having me unpack a completely stuffed laptop backpack packed with multiple laptops and a bunch of gear.  

The [Swissgear 1900 ScanSmartâ„¢ Laptop Backpack](https://amzn.to/2Ep4uez) is built tough and is equipped with an extra-large main compartment. The zippers are rugged and oversized. This makes it simple to use with gloves on. It features some adjustable side compression straps, a padded back panel with plenty of ventilation.

This is the backpack, heavily loaded with probably 50+ pounds of gear.

## Is the ScanSmart Backpack Worth it?

The ScanSmart lay-flat technology allows for laptop-in-case TSA scanning for most portable computers. I have never used this feature, but it's there.

I purposely bought this [Swiss Gear Backpack](https://amzn.to/2Ep4uez) so I can hold two laptops at the same time and I am very impressed. There have been times I held three laptops in this bad boy! Don't ask!

The backpack is made out of a combination of fabric and polyester and it holds up great! It has enough cushion that I feel safe setting it on the floor without much impact to my gear. 

## Video Review of ScanSmart Backpack

I posted this video a few years ago. So many people commented and said there were going to buy this [bag](https://amzn.to/2Ep4uez) since then. I am not affiliated in any way with this product directly. The images don't do this backpack justice. You should watch the video if you made it this far.

The ScanSmart 1900 laptop backpack also has two water bottle pockets which I use constantly. I use one pocket for a water bottle and the other for my tripod (it has a strap to hold it down pretty well).

It has an easy access laptop compartment (side entry) but to be honest, both laptop entrances are easy to access, in my opinion.
