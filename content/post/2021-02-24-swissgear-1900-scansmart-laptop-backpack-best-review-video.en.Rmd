## Pack your Gear

The [ScanSmart Laptop Backpack](https://amzn.to/2Ep4uez) is one of my most viewed YouTube videos. I have owned two of these now. My [YouTube](https://youtu.be/VTTnRMyFkB8) video of the review was such a big hit; I decided to write a blog about it.

I want to share a few comments I&#39;ve received from the video reviews. The feedback from others might motivate you to give the video a quick watch. It&#39;s a six-minute [video](https://youtu.be/VTTnRMyFkB8).

It feels great to get comments on videos. When I first posted the video, I had no idea it would be such a big hit. So here is another comment from solidsnake58.

Great review!  You've done a man's job, sir.  Just what I needed to see.

The comments are great, but please, check out the [video.](https://youtu.be/VTTnRMyFkB8) for an in-depth review. Nothing beats having me unpack a completely stuffed laptop backpack packed with multiple laptops and a bunch of gear.

The [Swissgear 1900 ScanSmartâ„¢ Laptop Backpack](https://amzn.to/2Ep4uez) is built tough and is equipped with an extra-large main compartment. The zippers are rugged and oversized, which makes them simple to use with gloves on. In addition, it features some adjustable side compression straps, a padded back panel with plenty of ventilation.

You will see the backpack in the below image, heavily loaded with probably 50+ pounds of gear.

## Is the ScanSmart Backpack Worth it?

The ScanSmart lay-flat technology allows for laptop-in-case TSA scanning for most portable computers. I have never used this feature, but it's there.

I purposely bought this [Swiss Gear](https://amzn.to/2Ep4uez)Backpack to hold two laptops simultaneously, and I am very impressed. There have been times I held three laptops in this bad boy! Don&#39;t ask!

The backpack is made out of a combination of fabric and polyester, and it holds up great! In addition, it has enough cushion that I feel safe setting it on the floor without much impact on my gear.

## Video Review of ScanSmart Backpack

I posted this video a few years ago. So many people commented and said there were going to buy this [bag](https://amzn.to/2Ep4uez) since then. I am not affiliated in any way with this product directly. The images don&#39;t do this backpack justice. You should watch the video if you made it this far.

The ScanSmart 1900 laptop backpack also has two water bottle pockets which I use constantly. I use one pocket for a water bottle and the other for my tripod (it has a strap to hold it down pretty well).

It has an easy access laptop compartment (side entry) but to be honest; both laptop entrances are easy to access, in my opinion.
